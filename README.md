# Sentiment-Analysis

Introduction to the Project:

The course-end project analyzes sentiments expressed in over 34,000 reviews for Amazon brand products within the e-commerce domain. The dataset contains attributes such as brand, categories, review titles, review text, and sentiment levels categorized into "Positive," "Negative," and "Neutral." The project aims to predict sentiment or satisfaction levels based on various features and review text.

Objectives of the Project:
* Understand the sentiment expressed in consumer reviews.
* Address class imbalance in sentiment categories. 
* Implement classifiers and advanced techniques for sentiment analysis.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
* Compare traditional machine learning algorithms with neural network approaches.
* Explore topic modeling techniques for clustering similar reviews.

Learning Outcomes:

This project gives practical experience in sentiment analysis, classification techniques, and advanced modeling approaches. Understanding of class imbalance handling, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.

Conclusion:

By systematically addressing the class imbalance problem, selecting appropriate classifiers, and exploring advanced modeling techniques, this project aims to develop an accurate and robust sentiment analysis model for e-commerce applications. Insights gained from the project will contribute to the understanding of sentiment analysis methodologies and their applications in real-world scenarios.
